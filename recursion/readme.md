## Recursion and Type of Recursion:
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function<hr>
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

## Types of Recursions: 
Recursion are mainly of two types:
 
    1.Direct Recursion:
        a)Tail Recursion
        b)Head Recursion
        c)Nested Recursion
        d)Tree Recursion
    2.Indirect Recursion
