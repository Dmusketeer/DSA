# inding single missing element in sorted array of Natural elements :
# Algorithm: 
# Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers as sumtotal= n*(n+1)/2
# Create a variable sum to store the sum of array elements.
# Traverse the array from start to end.
# Update the value of sum as sum = sum + array[i]
# Print the missing number as sumtotal â€“ sum
