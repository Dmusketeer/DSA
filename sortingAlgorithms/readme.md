# ----------------------------------- Sorting Algorithms -----------------------------------

- Sorting Algorithms are methods of reorganizing a large number of items into some specific order such as highest to lowest, or vice-versa, or even in some alphabetical order.

- These algorithms take an input list, processes it (i.e, performs some operations on it) and produce the sorted list.

Types of Sorting Algorithms :-
1) Quick Sort
2) Bubble Sort
3) Merge Sort
4) Insertion Sort
5) Selection Sort
6) Heap Sort
7) Radix Sort
8) Bucket Sort
